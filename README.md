# Malware Analysis Reports
> December 30, 2021 | Ryan S.

Since completing the Practical Malware Analysis and Triage (PMAT) course from TCM Security, if I have the motivation to do a full report on an intersting piece of malware, beyond just a mere blog post, it will be located here, along with YARA rules that I have written.

**This repository will NOT contain live malware.** <sub>i just don't want to deal with that on my host OS</sub>
